# Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1


## Loading and preprocessing the data

Unzip and load the data
```{r echo=TRUE}
unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv(file = "activity.csv",
                 na.strings = "NA",
                 colClasses = c("numeric", "Date", "numeric"))
head(data)
```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r echo=TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plyr)

nsteps.per.day <- ddply(data, "date", summarise, 
                        total.steps = sum(steps, na.rm = TRUE))
head(nsteps.per.day)

p <- ggplot(data = nsteps.per.day) +
        geom_histogram(aes(x = total.steps), binwidth = 2000) +
        labs(x = "Total number of steps taken each day",
             y = "Count",
             title = "Histogram of the Total Number of Steps Taken Each Day")   
print(p)
```

#### Mean and median total number of steps taken per day

```{r echo=TRUE}
mean.steps.per.day <- mean(nsteps.per.day$total.steps)
print(mean.steps.per.day)

median.steps.per.day <- median(nsteps.per.day$total.steps)
print(median.steps.per.day)
```




## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
